Abstract
-------
Mobile manipulators are intended to be deployed in domestic and industrial environments where 
they will carry out tasks that require physical interaction with the surrounding world, for example, 
picking or handing over fragile objects. In-hand slippage, i.e. a grasped object moving within the 
robot’s grasp, is inherent to many of these tasks and thus, a robot’s ability to detect a slippage 
is vital for executing a manipulation task successfully. In this paper, we develop a slip detection 
approach which is based on the robot’s tactile sensors, a force/torque sensor and a combination thereof. 
The evaluation of our approach, carried out on the Care-O-bot 3 platform, highly suggests that the 
actions and motions performed by the robot during grasping should be taken into account during slip 
detection for improved performance. Based on this insight, we propose an in-hand slip detection 
architecture that is able to adapt to the current robot’s actions at run time.
