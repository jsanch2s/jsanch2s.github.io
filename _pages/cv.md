A full version of my [CV]({{ site.url }}/files/cv.pdf) in PDF format is also available.


Research interests
------
* Robot manipulation, in particular grasping and contact interactions.
* Robot learning, e.g. reinforcement learning and learning from demonstration.

Education
------
* Current PhD in Robotics at the Universit√© Clermont Auvergne, France (Feb. 2016 - Mar. 2019<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>
)
  - My topic focuses on the manipulation of deformable objects using the Shadow hand robot equipped with BioTac sensors and the KUKA LWR+4 arm and a force-torque sensor.
* MSc in Autonomous Systems at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University, Germany (Oct. 2012 - Mar. 2015)
  - The [program](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/autonomous-systems-msc) is offered by the Computer Science faculty with a focus on robotics. Master's thesis title: _"Robust and Safe Manipulation by Sensor Fusion of Robotic Manipulators and End-Effectors"_.
  
Work experience
------
* Research assistant at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University, Germany (Apr. 2015 - Dec. 2015)
  - I worked on a research project, titled [AICISS](https://mas-group.inf.h-brs.de/?page_id=9), which focused on robust localization and navigation for mobile robots in crowded environments. One of the aims of the project was to perform fault diagnosis remotely. Afterwards I joined the [RoCKIn](http://rockinrobotchallenge.eu/) project, an EU-funded project focusing in innovating robotics through competitions.

* Teaching assistant at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University, Germany (Mar. 2014 - Aug. 2014)
  - Writing and grading assignments on the following subjects covering topics such as robot kinematics, linear algebra, signal processing and optimization.
